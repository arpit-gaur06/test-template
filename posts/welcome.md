# 3D Visualizations

**Overview**



```python
print("Hello World")
```

I can also write math equations:

$$
y = x^2
$$


I can create lists easily:

- One
- Two

I can also create numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two


Or, create a table:

| Name  | Age |
|-------|-----|
| Alice | 20  |
| Bob   | 21  |
